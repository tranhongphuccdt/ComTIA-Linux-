Default permission:
Change file's group and owner:
sudo chown name:namegroup <objectname>

* When compress file, use "tar" command to keep permission into tar also
Otherwise, after un-tar we will lose permission setting

* Access Control List -ACL
To turn on F-ACL we use command : ??
/etc/fstab  > file system table
getfacl <filename> > show all information about file permission
we also use getfacl to check whether system had already be enable F-ACL in file system
if run getfacl and return nothing => F-ACL was not enabled

To add more user or group to have permission on filename
setfacl -m g:username:accessright filename
example: setfacl -m g:Marketing:rw file.txt

To add more user or group to have permission on a directory
setfacl -m d:g:Marketing:rw foldername

Sticky Bit (t): to indicate a shared directory
chmod o+t foldername
