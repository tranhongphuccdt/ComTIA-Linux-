Logical Volume Management:

Logical Volume
Group Volume
Physical Volume

Physical Volume created from SDx
Group and Logical Volume could be added more capacity later.

sudo pvcreate
sudo gvcreate
sudo lvcreate
sudo gvextend > to add physical volume to group
sudo lvresize > to add more capacity to logical volume

to check information: lvs,pvs,gvs

After resize logical volume, system still could NOT recognize the change,
we need to run resize2fs command
Run df -h to check system disk status

To not format disk as logical volume:
we do as below order ( backward order compared to create procedure )
. umount lv
. lvremove
. gvremove
. pvremove

Filesystem Hierarchy:
Could be search in : www.pathname.com/fhs


/etc/ system configuration
/dev/ device
/boot/ boot file
/mnt/ mount point
/opt/ application add-on
/root/ home directory
/sbin/ system binaries
/tmp/ temp files
/lib/ shared library and kernel modules
/proc/ running process
/var/ various : log file of all applications, system, ID


WHere could we install applications:

/bin/
/usr/bin/
/sbin/
/usr/sbin/
/opt/ ( default )

command ps aux to see all running process in present OS

use command which <thing to search>
use command whereis <thing to search>  ---> it lists all places where <thing to search> location
example: whereis ssh
ans: /usr/bin.ssh   : where executable bin file storing
     /etc/ssh   : where configuration for ssh storing
     /usr/share/man/man1/ssh.1.gz : where manual storing
     
/END
